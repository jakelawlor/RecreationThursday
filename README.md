# Recreation Thursday


Here are my creations for social project, [#RecreationThursday](https://github.com/sharlagelfand/RecreationThursday), in which we replicate, remix, or revamp a curated art project every two weeks



## Week 1: [Curves and Straight, Alfred Hilto, 1948](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/205953)
